Worked in several areas of Technologies, such as Avionics, Tactical Systems, Nuclear Instrumentation, Engineering Technology, and Computer Sciences. 

So, I started learning electronics during seventh grade. By 9th grade I had advanced knowledge in both analog and digital electronics. I had just as much fun designing analog circuits like operation amplifiers as I did with designing digital circuits. I also started reading a lot about computers and wondering how hard it would be to make your own computer. This is when I started learning how to program.  Our high school had no computers of any kind. It was only 1969.  In 1970 I had two years of high school to get through. That summer it was time for me to start taking some university classes to get access to some kind of computer.

It was clear to me at that time that I wanted to go into Computer Science. The problem for me was I wanted to learn both hardware and software. At this time and point hardware (Electronics Engineer) and software theory (Computer Science) were two different careers. Things got better as time went by, so I just keep on plugging away.

I have been retired for lots of years and I steel like combine math, technology, and physics which can lead to some fascinating and groundbreaking innovations. Here are a few areas where these fields intersect:

1. Quantum Computing: This advanced field leverages quantum mechanics to process information at unprecedented speeds. It's a perfect blend of math (algorithms and cryptography), tech (quantum computers), and physics (quantum mechanics).

2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: These technologies rely heavily on mathematical concepts like linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. They also use physics for modeling and simulations, particularly in fields like robotics and autonomous vehicles.

3. Material Science and Nanotechnology: The study of materials at the nanoscale involves complex physics principles and advanced technology for manipulating matter at the atomic level. Math is essential for modeling and predicting material behavior.

4. Astrophysics and Cosmology: Exploring the universe requires a deep understanding of physics and advanced technology like telescopes and satellites. Math is crucial for making sense of the vast amounts of data collected from space.
