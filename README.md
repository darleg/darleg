Ok I was looking around for differnt methods for programming microcontrolllers. I saw that some off the new arduinos were basied on mbed-os. I happen to have a couple of AZ3166 were also based on mbed-os but for Azure only. Ok, this is what I an going to learn mbed-os with. Once I get the hang of it I will just use updated version of mbed-os.


I am using 6.9 mbed-os with Mbed Studio. Also using the PinName function. Checkout rgbled.h. Also using just a simple #define statement for C/C++. Exsample file OnBoard.h.
