Ok I was looking around for different methods for programming microcontrollers. I saw that some off the new Arduinos were based on mbed-os. I happen to have a couple of AZ3166 were also based on mbed-os but for Azure only. Ok, this is what I am going to learn mbed-os with. Once I get the hang of it I will just use updated version of mbed-os.

I am using 6.9 mbed-os with Mbed Studio. Also using the PinName function. Checkout rgbled.h. Also using just, a simple #define statement for C/C++. Example file OnBoard.h.

What the AZ3166 has a MXCHIP EMW3166 module that has a STM32F412RG MPU which can use the STM32Cube development tools.  So, this is what I will do next, and I will use the STM32CubeMX. The STM32CubeMX is a graphics to code editor that will write say 90% of the code for the STM32Cube system. Make the task a lot easier.
