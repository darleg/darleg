Worked in several areas of Technologies, such as Avionics, Tactical Systems, Nuclear Instrumentation, Engineering Technology, and Computer Sciences. So, I started learning electronics during seventh grade. By 9th grade I had advanced knowledge in both analog and digital electronics. I had just as much fun designing analog circuits like operation amplifiers as I did with designing digital circuits. I also started reading a lot about computers and wondering how hard it would be to make your own computer. This is when I started learning how to program.  Our high school had no computers of any kind. It was only 1969.  In 1970 I had two years of high school to get through. That summer it was time for me to start taking some university classes to get access to some kind of computer.It was clear to me at that time that I wanted to go into Computer Science. The problem for me was I wanted to learn both hardware and software. At this time and point hardware (Electronics Engineer) and software theory (Computer Science) were two different careers. Things got better as time went by, so I just keep on plugging away.I have been retired for lots of years and I steel like to play.
