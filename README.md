Ok I was looking around for differnt methods for programming microcontrolllers. I saw that some off the new arduinos were basied on mbed-os. I happen to have a couple of AZ3166 were also based on mbed-os but for Azure only. Ok, this is what I well use to learn mbed-os.

Method 1:
1. Download the Microsoft IoT DevKit Software
2. Removed the Asure and Telementry parts
3. used mbed cli to compile most of the examples
     a. These were all arduino compatible example
     
Method 2:
1. Download the the modefied mbed-os from github ARM or VSChina
2. I used the one from VSChina, because it had no warning or  compiling errors at the time. Also compiled with mbed cli.
3. This what you see on my github darleg as of now.
4. Ok the VSChina mbed-os is not on VSChina anymore so if you want it get it here, it will be removed soon so get it now.

Method 3,4, and 5 are all about pin or port renaming and use the up to date mbed-os from ARMmbed/mbed-os.
